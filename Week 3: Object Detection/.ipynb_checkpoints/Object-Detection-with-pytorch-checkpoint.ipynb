    "\n",
    "You are working on a self-driving car. As a critical component of this project, you'd like to first build a car detection system. To collect data, you've mounted a camera to the hood (meaning the front) of the car, which takes pictures of the road ahead every few seconds while you drive around. \n",

The video lectures had used the latter representation; in this notebook, we will use both representations, depending on which is more convenient for a particular step.  \n",

    "## YOLO\n",
    "\"You Only Look Once\" (YOLO) is a popular algorithm because it achieves high accuracy while also being able to run in real-time. This algorithm \"only looks once\" at the image in the sense that it requires only one forward propagation pass through the network to make predictions. After non-max suppression, it then outputs recognized objects together with the bounding boxes.\n",

    "- The **input** is a batch of images, and each image has the shape (m, 608, 608, 3)\n",
    "- The **output** is a list of bounding boxes along with the recognized classes. Each bounding box is represented by 6 numbers $(p_c, b_x, b_y, b_h, b_w, c)$ as explained above. If you expand $c$ into an 80-dimensional vector, each bounding box is then represented by 85 numbers. \n",

    "#### Anchor Boxes\n",
    "* Anchor boxes are chosen by exploring the training data to choose reasonable height/width ratios that represent the different classes.  For this assignment, 5 anchor boxes were chosen for you (to cover the 80 classes), and stored in the file './model_data/yolo_anchors.txt'\n",
